### P1: Movie Trailer Website

####Project 1: 
Server-side code that pulls from a local list of movies you wish to display to generate a movie trailer webpage.

Python3 is used to generate a static web page allowing visitors to browse movie posters, trailers, and additional information for each movie.
## Usage:
### Tools: 
 Python3 (Tested on Python 3.5x, although python 2x should work with only minor modifications)
 
 Web Stack (HTML/CSS/JS with jQuery & Bootstrap) 
### Setup:
1. Add **driver.py**, **media.py** and **fresh_tomatoes.py** to the same folder
  1. Create an additional folder in the same directory named "**movies**" (this can be altered in the driver.py)
  2. In the movies folder add or replace movies you wish to display as text files (examples provided)

### Run:
In terminal/command prompt run from the program directory

    python driver.py
    
For additional information:
